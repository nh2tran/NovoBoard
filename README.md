This repository includes the Python scripts of the NovoBoard evaluation framework for de novo peptide sequencing. The scripts include two main parts: 
  - calculation of the fragment ion, amino acid, and peptide accuracies;
  - generating decoy spectra, FDR estimation, and FDR validation.

Example ABRF dataset can be downloaded via the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_6azR4-YjTUfRYdsXbFhZL9lFvjdrIDh?usp=sharing
